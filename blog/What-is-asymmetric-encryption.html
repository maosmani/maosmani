                            <p class="fs-5 mb-4">
                      

                            </p>

<p class="fs-5 mb-4">
Let's assume that you want to send an encrypted message to your friend.
</p>
<p class="fs-5 mb-4">
But there is a big problem.
</p>
<p class="fs-5 mb-4">

 Your friend lives outside your country and you can not meet him to agree on a shared secret key that both of you will use to encrypt and decrypt messages.
</p>
<p class="fs-5 mb-4">

So until now both of you can not exchange encrypted messages because you do not have a secret key,  and you can not meet him to agree on a secret key.
</p>
<p class="fs-5 mb-4">

What will you do?
</p>
<p class="fs-5 mb-4">

You can use what is called asymmetric encryption instead of using symmetric encryption.

</p>
<p class="fs-5 mb-4">

So let’s dive into it:

 </p>
<h2 class="fw-bolder mt-5 mb-5">
What is asymmetric encryption?
</h2>
<p class="fs-5 mb-4">
 
When it comes to cryptography there is symmetric encryption and asymmetric encryption also known as public key cryptography.
</p>
<p class="fs-5 mb-4">

As we have seen in symmetric encryption we use the same key to encrypt and decrypt but in asymmetric encryption, we use two keys one is used for encryption and one used for decryption.

</p>
<p class="fs-5 mb-4">
The first key is the private key and it is used for decryption and must be kept secret.

</p>
<p class="fs-5 mb-4">
The second key is the public key and it is used for encryption and is publicly known.
</p>
<p class="fs-5 mb-4">
And they’re called a ‘Public and Private Key Pair.’
</p>
<h2 class="fw-bolder mt-5 mb-5">

How does Asymmetric Encryption work?

</h2>
<p class="fs-5 mb-4">
If you want to encrypt a message and send it to your friend then first you will need to get his public key.
</p>
<p class="fs-5 mb-4">

When you have his public key you can encrypt your message and send it to him.
</p>
<p class="fs-5 mb-4">

Then he will get your encrypted message and he will use his private key to decrypt it.

</p>
<p class="fs-5 mb-4">
When he decrypts your encrypted message he will get the plaintext message.
</p>
<p class="fs-5 mb-4">
 
Let's take a real example:

</p>
<p class="fs-5 mb-4">
Let’s assume that You want to send the following message to your closest friend.

</p>
<p class="fs-5 mb-4">

The message is “hello I want to meet you tonight at 20:00”
</p>
<p class="fs-5 mb-4">
Now you want to encrypt this message before sending it.
</p>
<p class="fs-5 mb-4">

The first step is to get his public key…
</p>
<p class="fs-5 mb-4">

When you get his public key you will encrypt the message by using your friend's public key  and then you will send the encrypted message to him.
</p>
<p class="fs-5 mb-4">

When he gets your encrypted message.

</p>
<p class="fs-5 mb-4">
He will use his private key to decrypt the encrypted message.

</p>
<p class="fs-5 mb-4">
After the decryption, he can read your original message “hello I want to meet you tonight at 20:00”
</p>
<p class="fs-5 mb-4">

So if you want to send encrypted messages to anyone the first step is to get its public key.
</p>
<p class="fs-5 mb-4">

And if anyone wants to send encrypted messages to you he needs to get your public key first.

</p>
<p class="fs-5 mb-4">
And then encrypt the messages by using your public key and then send the encrypted messages to you.
 
 </p>
