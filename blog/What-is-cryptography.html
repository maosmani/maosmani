                            <p class="fs-5 mb-4">
                      
<p class="fs-5 mb-4">
                            
Imagine what will happens if someone gets your phone or steals it from you.
Maybe he will find a way to unlock it.
</p>
<p class="fs-5 mb-4">
And what will happen if he  can unlock your phone he will be able to see all your images and files.
 </p>
<p class="fs-5 mb-4">
Or someone gets into your laptop and steals your documents or a file that you have written all your passwords or banking details on it.
</p>
<p class="fs-5 mb-4">
What will happen?
</p>
<p class="fs-5 mb-4">
He can log in to all your social media accounts or even worse he can log in to your bank account.
 </p>
<p class="fs-5 mb-4">
What you can do to make sure that if someone gets your files or gets your device he can not read your data.
 </p>
<p class="fs-5 mb-4">
The solution is simple: you can encrypt your files so if someone gets your devices he can not read them because they are encrypted.
 </p>
<p class="fs-5 mb-4">
The solution is to use the power of cryptography today we are going to talk about it so letâ€™s dive into it:
 </p>

<p class="fs-5 mb-4"> 
Cryptography is a science, it's used to keep information secret by transforming it.
</p>
<p class="fs-5 mb-4">
 so only the intended recipient or the owner of the files can understand the original information.
 </p>
<p class="fs-5 mb-4">
Cryptography allows you to convert ordinary plaintext and files into unintelligible text and encrypted files so no one can read them.
 </p>
<h2 class="fw-bolder mt-5 mb-5">
The main goal of cryptography is to protect data.
 </h2>
<p class="fs-5 mb-4">
For example, for protecting your files you can encrypt them so if someone steals your laptop from you he will not be able to read your files.

</p>
<p class="fs-5 mb-4">
Also, you can encrypt your images on your cell phone so if you lose it or someone steals it from you he can not see your images.
</p>
<h2 class="fw-bolder mt-5 mb-5">

The main Goals of cryptography:
</h2>
<h3 class="fw-bolder mt-5 mb-5">

Confidentiality:
 
 </h3>
<p class="fs-5 mb-4">
One of the main goals of cryptography is to make sure nobody reads your messages when you send them encrypted over the internet except the intended recipient.
 </p>
<p class="fs-5 mb-4">
And that is called Confidentiality.
 </p>
<h3 class="fw-bolder mt-5 mb-5">
Integrity:
</h3>
<p class="fs-5 mb-4">
When you send a message to your friend over the internet, hackers can change your messages And send what they want to your friend and claim that they are you.

</p>
<p class="fs-5 mb-4">
For this reason with integrity, you can make sure that nobody will change your messages.
</p>
<h3 class="fw-bolder mt-5 mb-5">

Non-repudiation:
</h3>
<p class="fs-5 mb-4">
When you send a message to someone else you can not say later that you are not who sent the message and this is called Non-repudiation.
</p>
<p class="fs-5 mb-4">
Authentication:
</p>
<p class="fs-5 mb-4">
Authentication allows you to prove who you are.
</p>
<p class="fs-5 mb-4">
In cryptography there are two processes:
encryption and decryption.
</p>
<h2 class="fw-bolder mt-5 mb-5">
What is encryption?
</h2><p class="fs-5 mb-4">
Encryption is the process of turning plaintext into ciphertext.
So if someone sees it he can not understand what is the original message or file.
</p>
<h2 class="fw-bolder mt-5 mb-5">
What is Decryption?
</h2>
<p class="fs-5 mb-4">
Decryption is the process of turning ciphertext into plaintext.
 </p>
<h2 class="fw-bolder mt-5 mb-5">
Types Of Cryptography:
</h2>
<h3 class="fw-bolder mt-5 mb-5">
Symmetric Key Cryptography:
</h3>
<p class="fs-5 mb-4">
In this type of cryptography, the sender and receiver have the same key and they are used to encrypt and decrypt data.
 </p>
<h3 class="fw-bolder mt-5 mb-5">
Asymmetric Key Cryptography:
</h3>
<p class="fs-5 mb-4">
In this type of cryptography, there are a pair of keys used to encrypt and decrypt data.
</p>
<p class="fs-5 mb-4">
The first key  used to encrypt the data and its name public key.
The second key  used to decrypt the data and its name private key.
</p>
<p class="fs-5 mb-4">
Public keys and Private keys are different.
 </p>


 <h2 class="fw-bolder mt-5 mb-5">

The keys in cryptography

</h2>

 <h3 class="fw-bolder mt-5 mb-5">

 The public key in cryptography

</h3>
<p class="fs-5 mb-4">
The public key used in asymmetric encryption to encrypt the message or data is only used to encrypt data and you can publish it on the internet or upload it to a key server because when someone knows it he can not use it to know what you have sent it is only used to encrypt data.

</p>
 <h3 class="fw-bolder mt-5 mb-5">

symmetric key in cryptography
</h3>
<p class="fs-5 mb-4">
The symmetric key is used in symmetric encryption and you must keep it secret the only two that can know it is you and the recipient and it is used to encrypt and decrypt the message.

</p>

 <h3 class="fw-bolder mt-5 mb-5">

The private key in cryptography
</h3>

<p class="fs-5 mb-4">
The private key is used in asymmetric encryption to decrypt the message or data and you must keep it secret the only one who should know it is you so do not share your private key with anyone.
</p>
